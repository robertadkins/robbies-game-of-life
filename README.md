Robbie's Game of Life
====================

A simple implementation of Conway's game of Life in Java.


This is a short project I began while bored on a Sunday. I may eventually add more features like:

  * State preservation - save state of grid to file for later use.
  * Reverse - run algorithm in reverse.
  * Check for malicious input - resize does not check for appropriate input
  * Performance - with larger sized grids, the program will hang upon pressing play
